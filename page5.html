        Lost the moment I saw those beautiful brown eyes, got the ticklish feeling that the world knows as "love at first sight".<br>
        Never thought you were the woman of my dreams, but look at me trying to look for you in each of my dreams 😊 <br>
        I maybe irritating but I do love you more than you could ever imagine, This valentine's day I created this, something new 🙂<br>
         only for you madam jiiiii only for you!! 🌹✉️
